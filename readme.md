# Open Data Sets

Information wants to be free.  To that end, the "open" web was created.

From its inception, the web was designed to be a universally accessible platform for the trustless exchange of ideas and information.  This space was created in service of that ideal.

In it you will find a growing number of datasets from various sources that you can download, analyze, fork and share. These data can also be baked into presentations, school projects, reports or applications.  It's up to you. And because we've licensed this project under MIT, you can repurpose any way you like (i.e. free or commercial use).

Whether you're a data enthusiast or a data scientist, I hope that you'll find the data useful and pay it forward in your own sphere of influence.

May the __***Source***__ be with you.
